          The Prestige is a 2006 British-American mystery thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan from a screenplay adapted by his brother Jonathan from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel The Prestige. Its story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage
          magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results.

        <p>In 1890s London, magician Robert Angier performs his trick, "The Real Transported Man" to a sold out theater. Rival magician Alfred Borden sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting
          water tank, where Borden watches him drown.</p>

        <p>At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingénieur John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of a Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for
          Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.</p>

        <p>Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside Cutter and assistant Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank from which she
          frees herself. When Borden ties her hands with a riskier slip knot, Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.</p>
        <p>
          Borden launches a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingénieur. Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who gives birth to their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping
          secrets and that sometimes he is lying when he says he loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant
          and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.....
