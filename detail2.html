          Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film about a team of astronauts who travel through a cosmic wormhole in search of a habitable planet as the Earth is ravaged by worldwide crop blights, dust storms and the atmosphere loses oxygen.Directed by Christopher
          Nolan. Written by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan.

        <p>In near future, earth is getting polluted and exhausted of resources due to which there are frequent dust storms which resulted in extinction of crops like wheat, rice etc. Corn was the one of the last one. In a time where they needed farmers
          more than engineers their only hopes for survival depends on either saving the crops with bio-technology or finding a place for humans on some another planet. The 2nd possibility is what is shown in the movie where mankind is struggling to find
          another inhabitable planet nearby. </p>

        <p>Now even this plan has further 2 plans, first is finding a planet suitable for human life and the second is taking the varied gene culture of humans to another planet and grow them there leaving all humans behind. The 2nd option was what professor
          (old guy) was thinking about.</p>

        <p>Now the thing where this movie becomes complex is when you see the ghosts and gravitational anomaly in murph's room. This movie dealt with a kind of time travel paradox known as predestination paradox in which a person travels back in time in
          order to prevent some event but accidently results in triggering the very same event. This kind of paradox is also seen in other movies like Terminator 1 and 12 monkeys etc. </p>

        <p>Now NASA was researching for life for a long time by sending manned missions to different planets through a wormhole near the planet of saturn. No one knows who put those wormholes there so we refer them as "they". NASA sent 12 missions to 12
          different planets. Their mission was send a signal back to the earth when they find the signs of life on a planet and go to long cryo sleep afterwards waiting for someone else to come and rescue them...... </p>
