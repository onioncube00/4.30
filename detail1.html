          The Legend of 1900 is a 1998 Italian drama film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and starring Tim Roth, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Mélanie Thierry. It was Tornatore's first English-language film. The film is inspired by Novecento, a monologue by Alessandro
          Baricco. The film was nominated for a variety of awards worldwide, winning several for its soundtrack.

        <p>1900 was found abandoned on the four stacker oceanliner SS Virginian, a baby in a box, and likely the son of poor immigrants from steerage. Danny, a coal-man from the boiler room, is determined to raise the boy as his own. He names the boy Danny
          Boodman T. D. Lemon 1900 (a combination of his own name, an advertisement found on the box and the year he was born) and hides him from the ship's officers. Sadly, a few years later, Danny is killed in a workplace accident, and 1900 is forced
          to survive aboard the Virginian as an orphan. For many years, he travels back and forth across the Atlantic, keeping a low profile.</p>

        <p>The boy shows a particular gift for music and eventually grows up and joins the ship's orchestra. He befriends Max in 1927, but never leaves the vessel. Apparently, the outside world is too "big" for his imagination at this point. But he stays
          current with outside musical trends as passengers explain to him a new music trend or style, and he immediately picks it up and starts playing it for them.</p>

        <p>His reputation as a pianist is so renowned that Jelly Roll Morton, of New Orleans jazz fame, on hearing of 1900's skill comes aboard to challenge him to a piano duel. After hearing Jelly Roll Morton's first tune 1900 plays a piece so simple and
          well known ("Silent Night") that the self-proclaimed inventor of jazz feels mocked. As Morton becomes more determined to display his talent, he plays an impressive tune ("The Crave") that brings tears to 1900's eyes. 1900 calmly sits down at
          the piano and plays from memory the entire tune that Morton had just played. 1900's playing fails to impress the crowd until he plays an original piece ("Enduring Movement") of such virtuosity that the metal piano strings become hot enough for
          1900 to light a cigarette. He hands it to Morton, who has lost the duel......</p>
